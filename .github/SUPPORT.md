## Before Asking for Help

A few things to check first:

1. You're using Python 3.11 or later
2. `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` is set and points to a valid service account JSON key
3. The service account has the required permissions in Google Play Console
4. You're running the latest version (`pip install --upgrade play-store-mcp`)

Check the [README](../README.md) for setup instructions and the [Troubleshooting](../README.md#-troubleshooting) section for common issues.
